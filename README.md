## Exploring FOG Episodes in the Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction Contest on Kaggle  

While delving into the **FOG (Freezing of Gait)** episodes in the Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction contest on **Kaggle**  

I decided to take a step back and conduct some research of my own  

To that end, I compiled the datasets into one and adjusted it according to the principle of **"presence of all values"**

Although the sample size was small, it demonstrated high perceptiveness and the potential to reveal interesting features. Let's see what it can show us!
